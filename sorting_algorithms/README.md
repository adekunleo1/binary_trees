# Sorting algorithms

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following programs are written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-bubble_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Bubble sort** algorithm |
| `0-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Bubble sort** algorithm |
| `1-insertion_sort_list.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Insertion sort** algorithm |
| `1-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Insertion sort** algorithm |
| `2-selection_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Selection sort** algorithm |
| `2-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Selection sort** algorithm |
| `3-quick_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Quick sort** algorithm |
| `3-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Quick sort** algorithm |
| `100-shell_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Shell sort** algorithm |
| `100-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Shell sort** algorithm |
| `101-cocktail_sort_list.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Cocktail shaker sort** algorithm |
| `101-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Cocktail shaker sort** algorithm |
| `102-counting_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Counting sort** algorithm |
| `102-O` | File that stores the best, average and worst case of the time complexity of the **Counting sort** algorithm |
| `103-merge_sort.c` | Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the **Merge sort** algorithm |

This project is done to practice algorithm in C language.

Thanks ALX Team for thi great opportunity
